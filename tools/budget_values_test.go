// The rune-boundary suite next door slides a four-byte rune across every cut in
// this package and scores 17/17 against mutation. It pins the CUTS. It pins no
// BUDGET: every one of its tests either supplies its own byte budget as a test
// constant (web_fetch's `max_chars: 64`, the scheduler's `budget = 500`) or is
// written in terms of the production constant it would have to hold in place
// (`straddlingLeads(maxWholeFileReadBytes)`). A fixture written in terms of a
// constant agrees with itself for every value of it, so all six of shell's
// budgets, the whole-file byte cap, both task-plan budgets, the scheduler's run
// budget and web_fetch's default could each be moved to an adjacent value with
// the entire package green.
//
// Each test below straddles one boundary: an input of exactly N, which must
// come back whole, and an input of exactly N+1, which must be cut to N. That
// pair reddens whichever way the literal moves. Where the cut keeps part of a
// string, the assertion marks a CHARACTER rather than counting bytes — a cut
// that keeps the wrong end of the input returns exactly the right length.
//
// These are insurance, not defect reports. Every value checked here was already
// correct; nothing was holding it there.
//
// ⚠️ This is a FLOOR, not a total: every budget named above is declared in
// package tools, and so is every budget this file can reach. It is not the list
// of budgets that decide what a tool returns. readSingleFile is the whole of the
// difference — it is cut by two independent limits and only one of them is here.
// It is the only such site: every other schema cut this package makes
// (TruncateAtRuneBoundary, TruncateList) is handed its budget as an argument
// declared here, so those budgets are in scope. TruncateFileRead alone carries
// its own, which is what puts it out of reach.
// maxWholeFileReadBytes (fs.go) is; schema.TruncateFileRead's line window is
// not, and its fileReadWholeFileLimit, fileReadKeepFirst and fileReadKeepLast
// are unreachable from this package because they are unexported in schema.
// All three are held next door in schema/truncate_test.go, though not all in
// this file's way: fileReadWholeFileLimit is straddled, while fileReadKeepFirst
// and fileReadKeepLast are asserted by value off a single oversized fixture.
// Read the two suites together before concluding a budget is covered, and when
// a cut moves to another package its pin has to move with it — a budget that
// leaves package tools leaves this list silently.

// markedRun returns n bytes whose last byte is a marker, so an assertion can
// name the byte the budget decides on rather than only the number of them.
//
// ⚠️ The marker has to be a byte the REST of the result cannot contain, not
// merely one the filler avoids. 'Z' reads like a safe choice and is not: the
// scheduler tool prints an RFC3339 timestamp, whose zone designator is a
// literal Z, so `strings.Contains(out, "Z")` was satisfied 400 bytes before
// the cut it was asked about. '~' appears in none of these tools' banners.
