// The read half of the same defect. The write paths were folded onto one field
// table and the two READ paths were left hand-written, which made them a third
// authoring of the same list with their own omissions — measured 2026-08-10:
//
//   - handleList named neither Description, TimeoutSecs nor WorkspaceID at all,
//     so a job's note, its wall-clock cap and its durable-memory binding were
//     invisible in a listing. Per ~/CLAUDE.md a shell job's cap is per-job and
//     several live jobs run at 1800 or 3600; a listing that never shows it makes
//     every job look like it runs at the five-minute default.
//   - handleGet printed WorkspaceID inside its `job.Type == "agent"` branch,
//     while the scheduler stores workspace_id on a job of any type and the tool
//     now sends it on any type. So a shell job with a workspace showed it on
//     neither read path.
//
// Both are silent. A caller who set a field and reads it back sees a job that
// simply does not have it, which is what a job that never got one looks like.
//
// ⚠️ The interesting fields here belong to agent jobs, so a case list written
// without thinking defaults to agent jobs throughout — and the type-gate bug
// above is then invisible to every case in it. Shell-job cases are the point.

// A shell job holding every field the gate used to hide: a description, a
// non-default timeout, and a workspace on a job whose type is not "agent".
