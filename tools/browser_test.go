// requestExpectingSuccess has five producers of a nil body and only two
// of them were pinned: the non-2xx above, and the transport error the
// cancellation case at the foot of this file carries. Measured 2026-08-21 on
// this branch with one mutation per producer: the marshal arm, the request-build
// arm and the body-read arm were all SILENT, and an inverted-condition control
// showed all three sites execute, so they are live branches nothing asserts
// rather than dead code.
//
// Two of the three are reachable without touching the package: the request-build
// arm through the connection's BaseURL, which is configuration, and the body-read arm through
// a response that stops early, which is any dropped connection. The marshal arm
// is not — every caller in this file hands it a map of strings — so it is left
// stated rather than papered over with a test that cannot fail for the right
// reason.
//
// Both tests below assert twice: the cause, which only one arm can produce, and
// that the failure is NOT a pinchtabStatusError. The second half is what stops a
// configuration mistake or a dropped connection from reading to whoever is
// looking as something PinchTab said.
