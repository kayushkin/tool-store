// findRecentlyModifiedGit fails in two ways that its own caller cannot tell
// apart, and that is the point: findRecentlyModified asks only whether an
// error came back, then consults ctx.Err() rather than the error it was given.
// So nothing downstream pins what either failure says, and both were free to
// become any other error without a single test noticing.
//
// The distinction is load-bearing one level up. "This is not a git
// repository" is the case the mtime walk exists to serve, and "the caller
// cancelled" is the case it must not serve — falling back there would start
// the expensive scan that the cancellation was asking to avoid.
