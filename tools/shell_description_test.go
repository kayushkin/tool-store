// A tool description is a cost control, and it is the only one this tool has.
//
// Shell applies no timeout of its own and has no background mode, so nothing in
// this package can stop a command that decides to wait. The single lever on that
// behaviour is the sentence the model reads on every turn, which is why these
// tests pin it: an editor trimming the description for tokens would otherwise
// remove a guard rail and leave a green suite behind.
//
// What made it worth its 52 tokens, measured 2026-08-01 rather than assumed: two
// `until [ -s FILE ]; do sleep N; done` calls on one host had been running for
// 90,830s and 90,362s — over 25 hours each — polling sentinel files that were
// zero bytes when the loops started and zero bytes a day later. Between them
// they had forked roughly 15,000 sleeps and produced nothing.

// pollingVerbs are the shapes the wedged calls above actually took. Naming each
// one costs a few tokens and buys a match the model cannot read past; "avoid
// busy-waiting" would have described both wedged loops without naming either.
