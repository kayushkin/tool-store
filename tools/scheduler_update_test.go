// The scheduler does not refuse a field it will not apply. It answers 200 and
// returns the row unchanged, so the only evidence of a dropped edit is the job
// in the reply. Measured live 2026-08-10 against the binary serving :8092:
//
//	PATCH /api/jobs/50 {"schedule":"0 6 * * *","command":"echo CHANGED"} -> 200
//
// with both fields unchanged in the echoed row and on re-read. The tool used to
// print "updated: schedule, command" for exactly that exchange.
//
// Which fields a real scheduler honours depends on which build is serving the
// port — HEAD takes all thirteen, older binaries take only the three below — so
// these tests drive both shapes rather than picking one and calling it the
// truth. Nothing here needs to know which binary is deployed, which is the
// point of reading the echo instead of the request.

// to honour and silently keeps its own value for the rest, which is what the
// deployed scheduler does.
//
// It also models the create decoder's one refusal: the real POST struct has no
