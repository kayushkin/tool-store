		// harness's prompt because the misuse belongs to this tool.
		//
		// Measured on the host that filed this, 2026-08-01: two
		// `until [ -s FILE ]; do sleep N; done` calls had been running for
		// 90,830s and 90,362s — over 25 hours each, ~15,000 iterations between
		// them — waiting on sentinel files that were zero bytes and stayed that
		// way. Nothing in this tool would ever have stopped them; Shell applies
		// no timeout of its own, so a waiting command waits for as long as its
		// caller's context lives.
		//
		// The sentence deliberately does not say "this tool has no timeout".
		// That is true of Shell itself but a consumer may wrap the context in
		// one, and a description that lies to the model in that harness is
		// worse than one that only states the rule. Priced against Anthropic's
		// count_tokens before landing: +52 tokens on the cached prefix, taking
		// this description from 37 to 89.
		Description: "Run one or more shell commands. Use commands[] array to run multiple in sequence (preferred). Each turn is expensive — maximize work per call. Never poll — no sleep, no until/while retry loop, no watch. A waiting command holds the session for as long as it waits. Check once and return; if it is not ready, check again on a later turn.",
