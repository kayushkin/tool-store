# About tool-store

## What it owns

`:8302`. The canonical registry of tools that can be given to a harness: MCP servers, CLI commands, in-process Go implementations and the harnesses' own built-in tools (`kind` `mcp`, `cli`, `local`, `harness`; `GET /kinds` lists them from `Kinds` in `tool.go`). It replaced agentkit and carries agentkit's in-process tools under `tools/`, seeded disabled. Claude Code's and Codex's built-in tools are seeded **enabled** by `cmd/tool-store/harness_seeds.go` as rows named `<harness>.<harness_tool_name>` (`claude_code.Read`, `codex.shell_tool`), with the `harness` and `harness_tool_name` columns set; `GET /tools?kind=harness&harness=claude_code` reads them, tool-store never runs them (`/invoke` and `/spec` answer 409, `/provision` refuses them), and on reboot an existing row keeps its `enabled` and description while its tags (`read-only`, `effects`, `runs-commands`) come from the seed file. A harness tool nobody seeded arrives through `POST /harness-tools/observed` (llm-bridge-server forwards the tool list Claude Code reports at session start): an unknown name becomes a row with `enabled: false` and tag `unreviewed`, so it is off in every session until a person reviews it with `PATCH /tools/{id}` (tags) and `POST /tools/{id}/enable`; a known name only has `last_seen_at` moved. The seeder only creates harness rows that are missing and never changes one that exists, so the database alone owns every harness tool's tags, `enabled` and description, and nothing but that route writes `last_seen_at`. `scripts/harness-tool-review.sh`, run daily at 08:30 by a scheduler shell job, lists unreviewed rows, claude_code rows not reported for 14 days and changes in `codex features list` in one noteboard todo tagged `harness-tool-review`, keeping the last codex list in a workspace tagged `harness-tool-review-state`. A database made before the harness kind is rebuilt on open by `migrate.go`, keeping every id and `instance_tools` row, and one made before `last_seen_at` gets the column added. It owns a tool's definition and numeric id, the master `enabled` flag, and which instances have opted in to which tool. Who may use a tool is grant-store's; which tools a session is offered is decided in llm-bridge-server (`internal/server/tool_provision.go` there). README "HTTP API" is the route table.

## Where this prompt lives

These sections are stored in agent-store as a project prompt collection and rendered, with identical text, to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the root of this repo, so that whichever file a harness reads it gets the same thing. Edit them on dash `/files`, or edit either rendered file: the 15-minute scan carries the edit back into the sections and out to the other file. The host prompt keeps one row for this repo with only what an agent elsewhere needs.

# How it works

## Global is master, then the instance opts in

A tool has a global `enabled` flag, set by `POST /tools/{id}/enable` and `/disable`. **Global is master**: `EnableForInstance` refuses a tool that is globally off (`ErrGloballyDisabled`, nothing written), and every read of an instance's tools joins on `tools.enabled = 1`, so switching a tool off globally removes it from every instance at once without touching their opt-in rows. `instance_tools` is the opt-in list — `GET /instances/{id}/tools`, `POST` and `DELETE /instances/{id}/tools/by-name/{name}`, and `GET /tools/by-name/{name}/instances` for the reverse view. The bridge's Tools page is its editor.

## Provisioning

`POST /provision` returns Claude Code MCP config for a set of tools, with each env value resolved from auth-store (`AUTH_STORE_URL`, `AUTH_STORE_TOKEN`). The request names the set in **exactly one** of three ways — `tools` (names), `tool_ids` (ids; what llm-bridge-server sends for a principal's granted tools or a bundle's members) or `instance_id` (that instance's opt-ins, MCP subset). An empty request and a request naming more than one are both errors (`provision.go`), and a request for a CLI, local or harness tool by name fails rather than returning less than was asked for; llm-bridge-server filters harness tools out before it calls. `GET /tools/by-name/{name}/spec` and `POST /tools/by-name/{name}/invoke` serve and run an in-process tool; `GET /locals` lists the local implementations compiled in. `GET /settings` describes every environment variable the process reads (`settings.go`, llm-bridge `servicesettings`); a test fails on an `os.Getenv` that is not declared there, and nothing is editable because no route has a gate. The `tools` package reads no environment variable: `browser`, `web_search` and `scheduler` are built with where PinchTab, Brave and the scheduler are (`tools.RegisterToolsThatReachOutsideServices`), and `inber`, which imports the package, builds them from its own environment.

# Access and operations

## Who may call it

No authentication. The unit sets `TOOL_STORE_ADDR=:8302`, so it listens on every interface. dash proxies it at `/api/tool-store/*` behind dash's login. Unit `tool-store.service`, binary `~/bin/tool-store`. ⚠️ **The tracked `tool-store.service` carries a value for `AUTH_STORE_TOKEN`, and this repo is public** — noteboard todo `25654f1f-d8d3-4210-9687-76f3e5ae5608`. Do not add another secret to the tracked unit: a token belongs in a host-local drop-in under `~/.config/systemd/user/tool-store.service.d/`, mode 600.

# Working in this repo

## Build, test and deploy

Module `github.com/kayushkin/tool-store`, root package `toolstore`, server in `cmd/tool-store`, local tool implementations in `tools/`. SQLite at `~/.config/tool-store/tool-store.db`. Plain `go build` and `go test ./...`. The build reads `../llm-bridge` through a `replace`, so `deploy-gate` checks that tree too. `deploy.sh` builds the settings registry from the running service's environment before it stops it; the service owns the names `TOOL_STORE_ADDR` and `TOOL_STORE_DATA_DIR` as prefixes (a misspelling of either stops the start), and not `TOOL_STORE_`, because `TOOL_STORE_URL` is how others find it. ⚠️ **Check `git branch --show-current` in the main clone before trusting `git log -1`**: this clone once sat on a side branch for weeks and commits were made there as if it were main, including one llm-bridge-server depended on. Every parked branch and worktree from that time was landed on main or found already there, then deleted, on 2026-09-25 (noteboard card `21cacf42-d867-4b54-aa6a-3828408d8e9e`).

## Generated TypeScript types

`./generate-ts.sh` runs tygo and writes the wire types to `ts/` as `@kayushkin/tool-store-types`. `tygo.yaml` excludes `store.go`, `server.go` and `settings.go`, so a wire type must live elsewhere to be rendered — `LocalDescriptor` sits in `tool.go` with `Tool` for that reason.
