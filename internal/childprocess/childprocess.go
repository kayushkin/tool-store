// Package childprocess spawns child processes that can actually be stopped.
//
// A plain exec.CommandContext gives the child the parent's process group and
// cancels it with a kill aimed at the direct child alone. Neither is enough for
// a tool that runs a shell command:
//
//   - The command is `bash -c ...`, so anything it starts is a grandchild.
//     Killing bash leaves those grandchildren running. Measured: a cancelled
//     `sleep 60 & sleep 60` leaves the backgrounded sleep alive.
//
//   - Grandchildren inherit the write end of the pipe the parent reads output
//     from. Wait does not return until that pipe is closed, so one backgrounded
//     process holding it blocks Wait forever — after the child is dead, and
//     after the context is cancelled. Measured: Wait was still blocked five
//     seconds after cancellation with the direct child gone.
//
// Every command here is therefore its own process group, cancellation signals
// the whole group, and Wait is bounded so a held-open pipe cannot wedge the
// caller.
