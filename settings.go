// The whole TOOL_STORE_ prefix is not owned. TOOL_STORE_URL is what other

// being declared here.
//
// Every secret is a string: servicesettings quotes a value that does not parse
// as its type, and a string always parses.

// Nothing here is Editable, and nothing may become so while the service has no
// operator gate: GET /settings is as open as every other route.
