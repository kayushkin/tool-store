"""Sabotage cases for the recency window in tools/recent_files.go.

`findRecentlyModified` answers "which files changed inside this window" twice,
by two strategies with two separate windows:

    recent_files.go:100  findRecentlyModifiedGit    sinceTime := time.Now().Add(-since)
    recent_files.go:146  findRecentlyModifiedMtime  cutoff    := time.Now().Add(-since)

Both are executed on every run of the suite, from tools/cancellation_test.go,
three calls, all at `time.Hour`, all in tests about cancellation. Nothing puts a
file near the edge of either window, so the mechanism runs and its position is
pinned by nothing. That is card `3c18632a`'s thesis and card `319a55bf` predicted
these rows would SURVIVE; this file is what turns the prediction into a result.

The two windows are mutated SEPARATELY. Moved together, a pass cannot say which
strategy its test actually holds — and on this file that matters more than usual,
because the two strategies do not filter on the same clock. `git log --since`
selects on COMMIT time; the mtime walk selects on the file's mtime. tool-store's
git path never re-checks mtime (memory-store's does), so the two windows are
genuinely independent cuts and one test cannot pin both.

Run with --diffs at least once and read each applied edit against its label. A
row prints the name it was given, not the edit it made.
