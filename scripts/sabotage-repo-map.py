"""Score tool-store's tests for the two codebase-survey tools by breaking them.

The scoring engine — and the rules it enforces as refusals — lives in
scripts/sabotage.py. This file is only the case list: one edit per mechanism
the suite is meant to pin.

    python3 scripts/sabotage-repo-map.py [--diffs] [--crosstable]

⚠️ **This is the engine's SIXTH copy, and it is the same blob as the other
five.** md5 `9a81a32e5827b59c1a3093bf88187b17`, taken with `git cat-file` from
blob `664f35f475edb9b7d018a28136211bf58a0ff53e` — what
`scheduler/fix/the-scorer-counts-occurrences-not-files`,
`bundle-store/docs/one-sabotage-engine-again`,
`agent-store/test/the-tracked-file-switch-is-unreached`,
`skill-store/test/the-seed-profile-switch-is-unreached` and
`skill-store/test/the-install-path-is-unreached` all carry. Diff before
editing; a seventh blob is a fork. Take the blob off the BRANCH, not out of a
working tree — those checkouts sit on whatever branch their last pass left them
on, and md5summing them answers about the wrong commit (221st).

⛔ **tool-store already held an OLDER, FORKED copy of this engine and it is
still out there.** `scripts/sabotage.py` at md5 `2932bd4d9d17510dd6dd5f9d53eeb83f`
(406 lines, against this one's 534) exists on two unmerged branches —
`fix/truncation-never-splits-a-rune` and
`test/truncation-budgets-are-pinned-to-their-values` — and on neither `main` nor
any other branch. It predates the 218th pass's needle-occurrence guard, so
every case scored by `sabotage-set-enabled.py` and the truncation plans on those
branches was scored by an engine that silently sabotages the FIRST of two
matching occurrences. Those runs want re-taking under this blob before their
numbers are quoted again; that is filed, not done here.

Why this seam is worth a scorer: measured on `main` — not on the branch this
file sits on, per the 223rd — a `panic()` on the first line of any of these left
`go test ./...` green:

    repo_map.go      RepoMap  buildRepoMap  parseGoFileCompact  parseGoFileFull
                     compactFuncSignature  compactTypeDecl  compactType
                     isExported  isStdlib  isRelevantFile  shouldIgnore
    recent_files.go  RecentFiles  formatRecentFiles  parseDuration

Fourteen functions across two files, executed by nothing. The census row named
two of them.

⚠️ **The three finders are the instructive exception and they are NOT in that
list.** `findRecentlyModified`, `findRecentlyModifiedGit` and
`findRecentlyModifiedMtime` all redden the suite under a `panic()`, because
`cancellation_test.go` calls the first one — and that test asserts a cancelled
call stops, never which files an uncancelled one returns. The reach guard reads
them as covered while nothing checks what they answer. Cases below sabotage all
three, and before this branch every one of them scored UNNOTICED.

📄 What these two tools are for is why the gaps matter past a coverage row.
Both are survey tools: an agent calls them to decide what a codebase contains
and what has been worked on, then acts on the answer without reading the files
to check it. A wrong line here is not a wrong render — it is a premise.

Case-writing rules inherited from the scheduler, bundle-store, agent-store,
seed-profile and install plans:

  - Prefer a DRIFTED VALUE to a deletion. It orphans no variable, needs no
    second edit, and is the likelier real-world regression.
  - A control is a case and obeys the case rules (220th).
  - Read every applied diff against its label (`--diffs`). A row prints the
    name you gave it, not the edit you made.
  - An UNNOTICED row is a claim about which LINE the engine moved before it is
    a claim about the tests (218th), and the case NAME is a claim the run can
    contradict too (221st).
  - Before reading UNNOTICED as a coverage hole, check whether the mutation is
    observable at all (221st).
  - Ask what would have to differ for a green row to flip (223rd).

⚠️ Needles here are anchored to their enclosing function wherever the fragment
repeats. `ModTime:      info.ModTime(),` appears in BOTH finders in
recent_files.go, and `if info.IsDir() {` plus the `baseName == ".git"` skip
appear in both files — the engine aborts on an ambiguous needle rather than
picking one, which is the 218th's fix doing its job, and the anchoring below is
what the abort asks for.

⚠️ Region this plan does NOT cover, declared rather than left to be
rediscovered. The other tools in the package (shell, fs, grep, browser,
web_fetch, web_search, scheduler, scratchpad, task_plan, end_turn) are not
sabotaged here and have their own suites or none. `childprocess` is used as a
fixture by the git finder and is not scored.

⚠️ `--crosstable` has NOT been taken for this repo and no `unreddened`
declaration is made below, because an empty one would read as "measured and
found none" rather than "not measured". The 222nd and 223rd passes left that
open and this pass does not close it either.

Score when filed by the 224th pass: 66/67 real mechanisms caught, both controls
behaved, exit 0. The 67th is the declared empty-name guard below, which no test
can separate because the mutation is unobservable.

Two rounds were needed and neither round was a verdict on the suite. The first
scored 60/66 with FOUR compile errors — cases that never ran, not weaker
UNNOTICEDs (223rd) — each one a deletion that orphaned a variable or an import;
they are rewritten above as drifted values or paired edits. Of the two real
UNNOTICEDs that round, one was a mutation nothing could observe (declared) and
one was a genuine hole in the suite (closed). The second round left one
UNNOTICED whose cause was the FIXTURE, not the tests: filepath.Walk already
yields lexical order, so deleting the sort changes nothing unless a file and a
directory share a prefix — "a.go" against "a/b.go", where the walk gives
[a/b.go a.go] and the sort gives [a.go a/b.go]. Measured with a throwaway
program rather than argued. That case now has a fixture that can see it.
