"""The sabotage-scoring engine, shared by every per-binary case file.

A test suite that passes tells you nothing on its own. A scorer applies one
edit per mechanism to the file under test, runs the suite, and records whether
anything went red.

Rules this engine carries, each one inherited from a night that lost time to
its absence:

  - The needle must be found. A replacement whose search string is not in the
    file is a case that silently did nothing and scored UNNOTICED (30th pass).
  - The file's bytes must actually change. An edit that changed nothing scores
    UNNOTICED for free, which is the same false result (33rd).
  - A case may carry a SECOND edit, so an orphaned import or variable reports a
    score instead of `compile error` (32nd, 35th).
  - Two controls. A known-positive (an edit every test must catch) and a
    known-NEGATIVE (an edit no test should catch). Without the negative, a
    harness that reports CAUGHT for everything looks perfect (33rd).
  - No needle text is handed to a shell (25th).
  - Restores from git, so the tree must be committed before running (27th).
  - Prints the diff it actually applied, because the row prints the name you
    gave it, not the edit you made (33rd).

The engine was extracted from scripts/sabotage-kanban-curator.py when cmd/ask
became the second binary to need it. Ten unattended passes had each rebuilt
this same logic from prose and hit the same traps doing it; a second copy would
have been the eleventh. A per-binary file supplies TARGET, PACKAGES and CASES
and calls score() — nothing else needs restating.
