"""The sabotage-scoring engine, shared by every per-binary case file.

A test suite that passes tells you nothing on its own. A scorer applies one
edit per mechanism to the file under test, runs the suite, and records whether
anything went red.

Rules this engine carries, each one inherited from a night that lost time to
its absence:

  - The needle must be found. A replacement whose search string is not in the
    file is a case that silently did nothing and scored UNNOTICED (30th pass).
  - The needle must be found ONCE. Appearing twice in one file passed the
    file-level check and sabotaged the first occurrence, scoring the wrong
    mechanism while reading as a verdict on the right one (218th).
  - The file's bytes must actually change. An edit that changed nothing scores
    UNNOTICED for free, which is the same false result (33rd).
  - A case may carry a SECOND edit, so an orphaned import or variable reports a
    score instead of `compile error` (32nd, 35th).
  - Two controls. A known-positive (an edit every test must catch) and a
    known-NEGATIVE (an edit no test should catch). Without the negative, a
    harness that reports CAUGHT for everything looks perfect (33rd).
  - No needle text is handed to a shell (25th).
  - Restores from git, so the tree must be committed before running (27th).
  - Restores on the way out even when the run is KILLED, not only on the exit
    paths the engine chooses to take (60th). SIGKILL is the one gap and cannot
    be closed by any process that receives it.
  - Prints the diff it actually applied, because the row prints the name you
    gave it, not the edit you made (33rd).
  - Contradicts a declaration in BOTH directions. An `expected_unnoticed` that
    is CAUGHT anyway has expired, and nothing used to say so (47th, 69th, 94th).
  - Splits a red run into detection and the fixture falling over. `go test`
    exits non-zero for both, so a mutation that only trips a reach guard scored
    a flat CAUGHT with no assertion having looked at the mechanism (42nd).

The engine was extracted from scripts/sabotage-kanban-curator.py TWICE, on two
branches, by two passes that could not see each other: 2ab59cc on
test/first-tests-for-kanban-dispatcher and 338ec17 on test/first-tests-for-ask.
Ten unattended passes had each rebuilt this logic from prose and hit the same
traps doing it; the two extractions were the eleventh and twelfth. A per-binary
file supplies TARGETS, PACKAGES and CASES and calls score() — nothing else
needs restating.

## This blob is the union of a THIRD fork, and here is what it cost

Landed by the 73rd pass as the union of the two extractions above, then forked
again. Measured by the 236th pass and unioned here by the 240th:

    9a81a32e  forge, inber-party, mailstack, skill-store, and the tool-store
              branch test/the-repo-map-and-recent-files-tools-are-unreached
    2932bd4d  tool-store main
    9d5ad6a0  scheduler
    3a7741d9  bundle-store

Neither side of the tool-store collision was simply stale. `2932bd4d` alone
carried the 42nd's guard classification — classify_caught, counts_as_coverage,
failure_messages, Case.expected_guard_caught — and lacked the 218th's
needle-once rule; `9a81a32e` carried the needle-once rule, the multi-target
shape, the cross-table and the stale-declaration check, and had never heard of
a reach guard. This file is both. Propagating it to the other five repos is a
separate decision and has NOT been done.

⚠️ **The fork reached the CALLERS, not only this file, and slot 4 is where it
shows.** `2932bd4d`'s signature ended `score(target, packages, cases,
guard_markers=())` and `9a81a32e`'s ended `score(targets, packages, cases,
unreddened=None)`. Two case files on this box already pass a fourth positional
argument, and they pass DIFFERENT things: tool-store's sabotage-truncation.py
passes GUARD_MARKERS, scheduler's sabotage-reminder-coordinator.py passes
UNREDDENED. A union that kept either in slot 4 would silently bind the other
caller's argument to the wrong parameter, and the direction that fails is the
quiet one — guard_markers landing in unreddened leaves guard_markers empty, so
classify_caught can no longer recognise a guard and every guard-caught row
reads as coverage. That is precisely the inflation the 42nd's split exists to
stop, reintroduced by an argument list. Both are keyword-only here, so a
positional caller raises TypeError at the call instead.

    An entry that covers no target package cannot go red for ANY edit to a

    uncommitted work: measured on the 60th pass, a scoring run of cmd/scheduler
    killed at a wall-clock cap left `case <-d.signals:` rewritten to `default:`

    pin nothing, so look for tests to DELETE. Read the same table the other way
    and it finds cases to ADD. A test the author wrote deliberately, that no case
    reaches, is evidence the author understood a failure direction the case list
    does not express — and a case list inherits the worry of the card it was
    drafted from, so that gap is the normal condition, not an anomaly.

    Each test runs in its OWN `go test -run` invocation (the 71st): a mutation
    that panics kills the test binary, and every test that had not run yet then
    reports as passing. Sharing one invocation would attribute that whole tail to
    "reddened by nothing", which is the exact verdict this mode produces.

    A case whose package stays green cannot have reddened any test, so its row is
    empty without running the tests one by one. That shortcut is only sound
    because a panic FAILS the package — a green package really does mean every
    test passed.

    `unreddened` maps a test name to why it is expected in that column: a
    degenerate-input or reach guard no single mutation can isolate. It is checked
    in BOTH directions. An undeclared test in the column is the finding. A
    declared test that some case now reddens is a stale declaration, and the 47th
    pass filed a card because nothing on this box ever contradicts one of those.

    ⚠️ Guard classification is deliberately NOT applied here. This mode asks
    which tests a mutation reddens, and a reach guard firing is a red test by
    that question's own terms; whether the red counts as coverage is score()'s
    question, and answering it twice in two places is how the two halves drift.

def problems(results):
    """Everything wrong with a scored run, as printable lines. Empty means sound.

    `results` is what run_cases() returns: (case, verdict, diff, detail) rows.

    This is the one definition of "wrong". print_score() prints it, and a caller
    that needs an exit status asks the same question rather than re-deriving it:
    a caller's own copy of these rules drifts silently, and always toward green,
    because the copy is the half nobody re-reads when a rule is added here.

    In particular it is NOT `caught < real`. A caller with those two numbers to
    hand will reach for that comparison, and it misses a known-negative control
    that WAS caught — the suite red for an unrelated reason, every CAUGHT above
    it worthless, and the run still scoring a perfect caught == real.

    The known-positive control is believed through counts_as_coverage(), not
    through `verdict == "CAUGHT"`. A control that only tripped a reach guard
    proves the fixture falls over, not that the suite is running, and that is
    the one row where reading red as running defeats every row below it.

    An `expected_unnoticed` is checked in BOTH directions, and until the 94th
    pass it was checked in one. A row that is UNNOTICED without a declaration is
    reported; a row that carries a declaration and is CAUGHT anyway used to be
    reported by nothing. The declaration is prose asserting that no test can see
    the mutation, so the moment someone writes the test that sees it the prose is
    false — and it is the one statement in a case file that can only ever rot,
    because nothing else in the run re-reads it. Measured on the 69th pass:
    cmd/autoworker carried seven declarations and two had been false for some
    time. The score arithmetic hides them, because the denominator counts every
    non-CONTROL case whether declared or not, so 51/53 reads the same either way.

    crosstable() has had the same check on its `unreddened` declarations since
    the 71st. This is the older path, and it is the half that did not learn.

    A CONTROL is exempt: a known-negative carries a declaration by construction,
    and when one is CAUGHT the control rule above already says so, more
    accurately — the suite is red for an unrelated reason, which is not the same
    finding as a declaration that has expired.

    """Apply each case to the target files, run packages, print the table, and
    return the (case, verdict, diff, detail) rows.

    Split out of score() so a case file that drives the engine once per target
    and adds the scores up — sabotage-truncation.py scores one mechanism spread
    over six files — can read the rows without either re-deriving the needle
    rules or forcing score() to hand back a report where a caller needs an exit
    status. The 73rd pass measured what that second choice costs: an engine
    returning a list under a `sys.exit(score(...))` caller exits 1 always,
    healthy or not, and a permanently red scorer reads as a defect in the binary
    rather than in the harness.

    `targets` is one Path or a list of them. A binary whose mechanisms live in
    more than one file needs more than one file sabotaged, and splitting that
    across two scorers splits the score with it — cmd/autoworker decides when to
    fire in main.go and how much the fire may cost in spend.go, and a score that
    covered only one of those would be a number for half a binary.

    With several targets a case still writes `(find, replace)` and says nothing
    about which file it means: the engine locates the needle. Finding it in TWO
    targets is an abort, not a choice — the case would silently score whichever
    file the engine happened to look at first.

    Pass --diffs to print the edit each case actually applied. A row prints the
    name you gave it, not the edit you made, and mislabelled cases have twice
    been read as coverage holes that were not there — so read the diffs at
    least once per case family.

    Pass --messages to print every line that went red, not just the first.

    ⚠️ `guard_markers` and `unreddened` are KEYWORD-ONLY, and that is a repair
    rather than a style. Two forks of this engine each put a different parameter
    in positional slot 4 and two case files on this box already fill that slot,
    with different things — see the fork section in the module docstring. Bind
    the wrong one and nothing raises: empty guard_markers just makes
    classify_caught blind, and every guard-caught row reads as coverage again.

    ⚠️ The exit status is the whole point of the return value and it was once
    lost. The 338ec17 extraction returned the results list instead of a status.
    Measured on the 54th nightly pass: a scorer whose known-positive control
    went UNNOTICED printed "the suite is not running" and still exited 0, so
    nothing running this from a script or a guard could tell a clean sweep from
    a broken one. Return a status, not a report.

    Re-measured on the 73rd, and the mechanism is worth stating exactly, because
    the engine's return type alone does not decide it — the CALLER does:

      - `score(...)` bare, no sys.exit  -> exits 0 always. This is what the 54th
        found, and it is still live on test/first-tests-for-ask.
      - `sys.exit(score(...))` with this engine returning a list -> Python
        prints the repr and exits 1 ALWAYS, healthy or not. A permanently red
        scorer is as useless as a permanently green one and looks like a defect
        in the binary rather than in the harness.

    So a scorer is only trustworthy when a status-returning engine and a
    sys.exit caller are BOTH present. Verify in both directions: healthy suite
    -> 0, un-catchable known-positive control -> 1.
