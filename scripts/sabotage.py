"""The sabotage-scoring engine, shared by every per-binary case file.

A test suite that passes tells you nothing on its own. A scorer applies one
edit per mechanism to the file under test, runs the suite, and records whether
anything went red.

Rules this engine carries, each one inherited from a night that lost time to
its absence:

  - The needle must be found. A replacement whose search string is not in the
    file is a case that silently did nothing and scored UNNOTICED (30th pass).
  - The file's bytes must actually change. An edit that changed nothing scores
    UNNOTICED for free, which is the same false result (33rd).
  - A case may carry a SECOND edit, so an orphaned import or variable reports a
    score instead of `compile error` (32nd, 35th).
  - Two controls. A known-positive (an edit every test must catch) and a
    known-NEGATIVE (an edit no test should catch). Without the negative, a
    harness that reports CAUGHT for everything looks perfect (33rd).
  - No needle text is handed to a shell (25th).
  - Restores from git, so the tree must be committed before running (27th).
  - Prints the diff it actually applied, because the row prints the name you
    gave it, not the edit you made (33rd).

The engine was extracted from scripts/sabotage-kanban-curator.py when cmd/ask
became the second binary to need it. Ten unattended passes had each rebuilt
this same logic from prose and hit the same traps doing it; a second copy would
have been the eleventh. A per-binary file supplies TARGET, PACKAGES and CASES
and calls score() — nothing else needs restating.

    # to leave the broken file in the tree as ordinary-looking uncommitted work:
    # a semantic edit to a tracked source file, which `git status` reports the
    # same way it reports real work in progress, and which this box's standing
    # rule tells the next agent not to throw away. The next run then refuses to
    # start, because of the mess the last one made.
    #
    # A try/finally alone does NOT close this, and measuring it is how you find
    # that out. Python raises KeyboardInterrupt for SIGINT, so a finally is on
    # the way out for that one and for nothing else. SIGTERM and SIGHUP kill the
    # process between the write and the restore — and those are exactly what a
    # wall-clock cap, systemd and a process-group kill send. So the one signal a
    # finally covers is the one you press by hand while watching, and the ones it
    # misses are the ones an unattended run actually receives. Measured by kill
    # on this engine before these handlers existed: SIGTERM and SIGHUP each left
    # the mutated file behind.

    # so the process dies BY the signal (rc 128+signum). A handler that restores
    # and exits 0 tells every caller a killed run succeeded.

    # SIGKILL cannot be caught by the process that receives it. It is the one gap
    # left here, and it is named rather than papered over.
