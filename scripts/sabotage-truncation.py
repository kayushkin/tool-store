"""Sabotage cases for the rune-safe truncation work.

The defect this scores is one mechanism spread over six files: a shared pair of
helpers, and five tools that cut a string down to a byte budget. This drives the
engine once per file and adds the scores up.

That used to be forced — the fork of sabotage.py this repo carried scored one
file at a time. The unioned engine takes several targets in one table, and a
table per file is still what this file wants: each call site has its own case
list, the per-file heading is what makes a row's target readable, and a case
list flattened across six files would have to lengthen every needle that two
of them happen to share.

Scoring the helper alone would not be enough. The helper's own tests could be
perfect while a call site still byte-cuts, and that is exactly the state this
repo was in before tonight — so every call site gets a case that puts the plain
byte cut back, and it has to go red.

Run with --diffs at least once and read each applied edit against its label. A
row prints the name it was given, not the edit it made.
