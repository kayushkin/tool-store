# @kayushkin/tool-store-types

TypeScript types for tool-store's wire format, generated from the Go types in the
root package with [tygo](https://github.com/gzuidhof/tygo). The Go package is
the source of truth; do not edit `model.ts` by hand. Regenerate with
`./generate-ts.sh` at the repo root; `tygo.yaml` names the files it reads.

Source-only for now: install with `file:../tool-store/ts`.
